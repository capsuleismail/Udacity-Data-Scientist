## Installations 
- OS

## Project Motivation
I found this dataset on Kaggle and when I saw that I could combine my interest in finance with programming languages I decided to download it and have a look into the data. 
Through this data I aim to analyse a few things such as:
-A general overview of which nations had a large number of stocks in a certain range.
-Comparison between the two indexes on the volume.
-Comparison between the two countries on the volume multiplied by the opening value.
-Comparison between the two indexes on the difference between the opening and closing value.
-Comparison between the two indexes on the difference between the highest and lowest value.
-Which indices is more volatile?
-Through an OHLC, see the differences, if any.
-Which indices has the most high value in return investment.

## File Descriptions
There is one notebook available and a folder with all graphs created for the analysis and there are also markdown cells that been used to explain the processes.
