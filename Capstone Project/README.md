## Installations
 - NumPy
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib
 - YahooFinance
 - os
 - warnings
 - scipy
 - time
 - datetime
 - plotly.express
 - plotly.graph_objects
 - from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

Only Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Motivation
The goal for this project is to predict when the price goes up or down.

The project involved:
 - Loading dataset and save it into a folder.
 - Data Exploration.
 - EDA and Data Preprocessing.
 - Feature Engineering.
 - Model RandomForestClassifier and LogisticRegression and use RandomSearchCV to improve the accuracy.

## File Descriptions
The folder stocks contains all csv files downloaded from YahooFinance and loaded with panda into the Jupyter Notebook.
