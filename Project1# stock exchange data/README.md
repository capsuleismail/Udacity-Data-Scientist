## Project Motivation
I found this dataset on Kaggle and I analyzed the stock exchange data to have a better understanding on the variations over the time. 
In this dataset I'll go through these questions:  <br />
-A general overview of which nations had a large number of stocks in a certain range.  <br />
-Comparison between the two indexes on the volume.  <br />
-Comparison between the two countries on the volume multiplied by the opening value.  <br />
-Comparison between the two indexes on the difference between the opening and closing value. <br />
-Comparison between the two indexes on the difference between the highest and lowest value. <br />
-Which indices is more volatile? <br />
-Through an OHLC, see the differences, if any.  <br />
-Which indices has the most high value in return investment.  <br />

## File Descriptions
There is one notebook available and a folder with all graphs created for the analysis and there are also markdown cells that been used to explain the processes.
