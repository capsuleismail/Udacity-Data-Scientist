# Stock Exchange Data 

## Installations 
- OS
- Numpy
- Pandas 
- matplotlib
- plotpy
- seaborn

My installations used in this project is Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebook.


## Project Motivation
I found this dataset on Kaggle and I analyzed the stock exchange data to have a better understanding on the variations over the time. 
In this dataset I'll go through these questions:  <br />
-A general overview of which nations had a large number of stocks in a certain range.  <br />
-Comparison between the two indexes on the volume.  <br />
-Comparison between the two countries on the volume multiplied by the opening value.  <br />
-Comparison between the two indexes on the difference between the opening and closing value. <br />
-Comparison between the two indexes on the difference between the highest and lowest value. <br />
-Which indices is more volatile? <br />
-Through an OHLC, see the differences, if any.  <br />
-Which indices has the most high value in return investment.  <br />

I'm a recent graduate in BSc and I been always interested in Stock Exchange. I had the opportunity to analyze this dataset and to share my analysis via Medium where the reader can find the process that lead me to the conclusions.

## File Descriptions
There is one notebook available and a folder with all graphs created for the analysis and there are also markdown cells that been used to explain the processes.

## Medium Blog Post 
The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@isma.ali1993/stock-exchange-analysis-661230ca13aa)
